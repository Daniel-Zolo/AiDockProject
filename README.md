### DevOps assignment with Terraform/AWS tasks

This repository holds 2 different versions of Terraform files, one for the candidate to work on and one as a baseline for result evaluation. 

```
├── result
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── providers.tf
│   └── variables.tf
└── test
    ├── README.md
    ├── main.tf
    ├── providers.tf
    └── variables.tf
```

Requirements for candidate's test system:

- IDE (PyCharm, IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code) or macOS/Linux shell with vim or other editor
- Terraform command line (https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- AWS cli (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- AWS user credentials

Alternatively, the candidate could be provided with a system that has the AWS CloudShell prepared with access to github.com, in this case AWS credentials would not be required separately as they must already be used for starting CloudShell.
